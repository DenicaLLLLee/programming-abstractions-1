Exercises from the book

As I follow along with Stanford's CS106B class I'm doing all the exercises in the reader:

Programming Abstractions in C++ by Eric S. Roberts.

The Stanford CPP Libraries are 32 bit and can present some problems.  Xcode or Qt Creator can get things running but it’s not perfect.  I’m searching for a simple command line solution.  So far using clang++/g++ with -l -L -I tags seems to work on a 32 bit machine but some of the library files won’t compile on my 64bit iMac unless I use Xcode.  I can’t get command line options for building in 32 bit mode to work on my 64 bit machine :/  … yet
